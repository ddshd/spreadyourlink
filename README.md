# SpreadYourLinks

## What is it?

I hated typing out URLs on screen that are not designed for it so I creaated this quick application.

## How does it work?

It's a pretty simple concept - it has three basic components:

1. A database to hold URL you have quick access to
2. An easy way to share links to that database
3. A simple front-end to quickly access that URL
